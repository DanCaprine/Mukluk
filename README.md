Mukluk MUD Client is an Android M* (MUDs, MUSHs, MOOs, etc.) client that was originally added to the Google Play Store in 2010. It featured full ANSI support and the ability to connect to multiple worlds simultaneously. 

Mukluk no longer works on more recent versions of Android due to changes in the operating system's behavior and security. The source code is provided for anybody to do whatever they like with it. Enjoy!
