Mukluk MUD Client is an Android M* Client that was available on the Google Play Store from 2010 to November 1st, 2022. Features included full ANSI support and the ability to connect to multiple worlds simultaneously. 

I won't be able to provide any build or usage support, but the code is released under the MIT license, so you can do whatever you like with it. Enjoy!
